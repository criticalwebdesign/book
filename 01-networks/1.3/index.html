	<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
	<p>
		We are both artists who first came to interactive media design with industry experience that included commercial, institutional, and non-profit clients, as well as other experiences directing artistic, experimental, and educational projects. We are also educators who regularly teach a variety of students with different skill levels and backgrounds in interactive media design classes. We have taught at a liberal arts college, a STEM university, State universities, community colleges, and for-profit design institutions. We have taught thousands of students during the past twenty years. This book is an opportunity for us to organize and distribute our ideas for students we teach, and to share them with readers outside of the classroom.

		The courses we teach have titles like “critical web design,” “interactive media design,” “internet studio,” “net art,” “multimedia,” and more. All of these course descriptions would include techniques for the creative production of projects that could be experienced in the web browser. Many of the course descriptions would also include an art historical overview or an introduction to the history of science and technology as it relates to the world wide web (WWW). These courses attract students with varying backgrounds and interests: some became professional designers, others became professional artists, some are entrepreneurs, and many of them now work in professional industries such as marketing, advertising, or journalism. Sometimes we felt like we were “sneaking” art education into a classroom that was designed (by someone else, usually an administrator) to address a bulleted list of techniques for creative decision making across a variety of outcomes. The accumulation of these experiences has led us to balance our method for delivering the course that inspired this book with information across several disciplines: the history of the internet; examples of artworks made for viewing or interacting on the internet; foundations of design as they may apply to the production of visual projects for interaction online; issues central to designing media for online audiences such as accessibility and inclusion; techniques for creating responsive interactive designs; design methods that encourage empathizing with users and prevent deceptive design; and design concepts that inspire contemporary projects, such as speculative design.

				My name is Owen Mundy (he/him). I am based in Davidson, North Carolina. I usually identify as an artist and designer, since I am always using both of these perspectives when I make these things. My favorite technologies are whatever the idea dictates, but usually I choose one that allows. One of my favorite works online is The Nicest Place because it makes me happy every time I see it. It doesn't try to be more than it is — a collection of videos of people around the world giving virtual hugs to visitors, countering the commerciality and pessimism so commonly found online.

				My name is xtine burrough (x/x or she/her). I live in Dallas, Texas where I teach at UT Dallas. I refer to myself as a hybrid artist, a media artist, and an artist-scholar, depending on who I’m talking with; and I have seen my work categorized as new media, electronic literature, installation, remix, and digital poetry. My studio practice is fluid. My favorite technology offline is an X-acto knife, and in terms of digital tools I love the laser cutter. I also enjoy working within the confines of the browser, and meeting audiences with unexpected media on social platforms. While I’m generally drawn to political artwork, one of my favorite online works is the Colour Clock. It’s always accurate and is mesmerizing to watch.

			<p>We love Endless.horse (2015) by Colleen Josephson and Kyle Miller. It depicts an ASCII art horse with legs that automatically grow as users scroll. Created during the Stupid Shit No One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon, we are tickled by the simplicity and humor in this piece.</p>
