	<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
	<p style="width: 460px;">
		We are artists who first came to interactive media design with industry experience that included
		commercial, institutional, and non-profit clients, as well as other experiences directing artistic,
		experimental, and educational projects. We are also educators who regularly teach a variety of students with
		different skill levels and backgrounds in interactive media design classes.
	<br>	
		The courses we teach have titles like ‚Äúcritical web design,‚Äù ‚Äúinteractive media design,‚Äù ‚Äúinternet studio,‚Äù ‚Äúnet
		art,‚Äù ‚Äúmultimedia,‚Äù and more. All of these course descriptions would include techniques for the creative
		production of projects that could be experienced in the web browser. Many of the course descriptions would also
		include an art historical overview or an introduction to the history of science and technology as it relates to
		the world wide web (WWW). These courses attract students with varying backgrounds and interests: some became
		professional designers, others became professional artists, some are entrepreneurs, and many of them now work in
		professional industries such as marketing, advertising, or journalism. Sometimes we felt like we were ‚Äúsneaking‚Äù
		art education into a classroom that was designed (by someone else, usually an administrator) to address a
		bulleted list of techniques for creative decision making across a variety of outcomes.

				<p>My name is Owen Mundy (he/him). I am based in Davidson, North Carolina. I usually identify as an artist
				and designer, since I am always using both of these perspectives when I make these things. My favorite
				technologies are whatever the idea dictates, but usually I choose one that allows. One of my favorite
				works online is The Nicest Place because it makes me happy every time I see it. It doesn't try to be
				more than it is ‚Äî a collection of videos of people around the world giving virtual hugs to visitors,
				countering the commerciality and pessimism so commonly found online.</p>

				My name is xtine burrough (x/x or she/her). I live in Dallas, Texas where I teach at UT Dallas. I refer
				to myself as a hybrid artist, a media artist, and an artist-scholar, depending on who I‚Äôm talking with;
				and I have seen my work categorized as new media, electronic literature, installation, remix, and
				digital poetry. My studio practice is fluid. My favorite technology offline is an X-acto knife, and in
				terms of digital tools I love the laser cutter. I also enjoy working within the confines of the browser,
				and meeting audiences with unexpected media on social platforms. While I‚Äôm generally drawn to political
				artwork, one of my favorite online works is the Colour Clock. It‚Äôs always accurate and is mesmerizing to
				watch.

			<p>We love Endless.horse (2015) by Colleen Josephson and Kyle Miller. It depicts an ASCII art horse with
				legs that automatically grow as users scroll. Created during the Stupid Shit No One Needs & Terrible
				Ideas Hackathon, we are tickled by the simplicity and humor in this piece.</p>
