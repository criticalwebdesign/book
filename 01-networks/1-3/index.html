<!--Here we used an inline CSS style to add a background gradient color and increase the margins on the page -->

<body style="background: linear-gradient(180deg, aquamarine, yellow,  aquamarine); margin: 24px;">

	<!--Another inline style to increase the size of the type in our page heading-->

		We are artists who first came to interactive media design with industry experience that included
		commercial, institutional, and non-profit clients, as well as other experiences directing artistic,
		experimental, and educational projects. We are also educators who regularly teach a variety of students with
		different skill levels and backgrounds in interactive media design classes.

			<p>My name is Owen Mundy (he/him). I am based in Davidson, North Carolina. I usually identify as an artist
				and designer, since I am always using both of these perspectives when I make these things. My favorite
				technologies are whatever the idea dictates, but usually I choose one that allows flexibility. One of my
				favorite
				works online is <em>The Nicest Place</em> because it makes me happy every time I see it. It
				doesn&rsquo;t try to be
				more than it is â€” a collection of videos of people around the world giving virtual hugs to visitors,
				countering the commerciality and pessimism so commonly found online.</p>

				My name is xtine burrough (x/x or she/her). I live in Dallas, Texas where I teach at UT Dallas. I refer
				to myself as a hybrid artist, a media artist, and an artist-scholar, depending on who I&rsquo;m talking
				with;
				and I have seen my work categorized as new media, electronic literature, installation, remix, and
				digital poetry. My studio practice is fluid. My favorite technology offline is an X-acto knife, and I
				love using
				the laser cutter. I also enjoy working within the confines of the browser,
				and meeting audiences with unexpected media on social platforms. While I&rsquo;m generally drawn to
				political
				artwork, one of my favorite works from the CWD is James Bridle&rsquo;s <em>Do It</em> from 2020. The
				whole project lives in a call to action and a simple Javascript function. I usually showcase this
				project to students while breaking apart our university&apos;s home page.

			<p>We love Endless.horse (2015) by Colleen Josephson and Kyle Miller. It depicts an ASCII art horse with
				legs that automatically grow as users scroll. Created during a hackathon, we are tickled by the
				simplicity and humor in this piece.</p>
